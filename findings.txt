Networkign in separated from the host system by default and ports need to be specifically exposed/mapped to host ports
to allow connectivity. Docker networking also allos name resolving by container / service names inside the docker network
instead of using addresses. The host doesn't share ip with the containers.

processes are container specific and running inside the container and are not shared with the system.

Available disk space directly correlates with the host system available disk.
Filesystem in theory is shared though mounting has to be done to interactively handle files and their maintenance between starts.

Uptime gives host information instead of container information for the time since last reboot.
